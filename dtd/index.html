                What We Do.
            </h1>
            <p class="smallcontent"> Our era has come to see the vital importance of digital technology in our daily
                lives.
                It allows us to unlock a huge collection of information and communication data. Each kind of task, be it
                a regular task or a job specific task requires digital proficiency or literacy.
                Digital literacy can be defined as “the ability to use digital technology, communications tools, and or
                networks to access, manage, integrate, evaluate, and create information in order to function in a
                knowledge society” (Lemke, 2003).
                The execution of a successful approach for the advancement of digital literacy skills is known to
                include multiple components that tackle hurdles for explicit demographics such as; attitude, age,
                socioâ€economic status, language, and regional availability of resources.
                In order to increase digital literacy levels strategies must be targeted and implemented, where
                necessary for specific populations and situations keeping an account of different obstacles. According
                to (Castells, 2009) there is a technological transformation with the increasing use of internet access.
                Therefore, technology transforms the mode or platform in which we converse and process knowledge. A
                substantive growth in execution of information and communications requires improvement in quality of
                life and development by preparing people for a knowledge society.
                sAs said by (Castells 2009, pg 21) networks demonstrate strength in their flexibility, adaptability and
                capacity to self configure. Therefore networking is here to reside and education has no alternative but
                embrace it. In this essay the basic focus is on the need to develop nation’s digital skills at all
                levels as it is gradually becoming important in the present period where technology and its benefits are
                becoming more sophisticated and pervasive. By critically discussing whether developing the nation’s
                digital skills at all levels helps in achieving fairness rather than amplifying it in the presence of
                various inequalities?
